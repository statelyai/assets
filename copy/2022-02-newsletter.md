# ðŸš€ Weâ€™re giving you access to the Stately Editor beta

Weâ€™re excited to announce the [public beta of the Stately Editor](https://stately.ai/editor)!

The Stately Editor is a tool for creating and editing state diagrams. Weâ€™ve received a lot of great feedback from the private beta testers, and now weâ€™re delighted to share it with everyone.

The software development lifecycle today is a bit fragmented. Itâ€™s very difficult for user stories, designs, code, tests, and documentation to stay in sync, leading to parts going out-of-date or even missing entirely. Bugs increase, and adding or modifying features becomes increasingly complex. And even understanding all the features and use-cases of an app becomes a daunting task.

Our mission is to make app logic accessible to the entire team, including developers, designers, and stakeholders. Using state machines and statecharts as a common visual language, the software development cycle becomes more collaborative, eliminating handoff and tightening the feedback loop.

The Stately Editor aims to be that collaborative visual app logic tool. Before, developers could build state machines and statecharts in code using [XState](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate). Now, you can create those same state machines and statecharts visually.

And yes, it goes both ways: edit the code and see the updated statechart. Edit the statechart diagram and see the updated code. All in real-time.
