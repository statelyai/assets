# Introducing Stately Studio 1.0

- We're excited to announce... (intro text)

## Thank you

- Released editor beta earlier this year and Stately viz about a year ago, as well as XState VS Code extension
- Since then, over 10,000 of you tried it out and created/shared tens of thousands of machines (we don't know the exact number because machines from the extension are always private)
- Thank you for your support and providing valuable feedback (link to statelyai.canny.io)

## Stately Teams

- We've introduced Teams, where you can organize and privately share and edit Projects (n√©e Systems) with your teammates
- This is the first step to more powerful collaboration features coming soon:
  - GitHub integration (public + private repos)
  - Commenting
  - Machine revisions and visual diffs
  - Multiplayer mode (edit machines collaboratively in real-time)
  - And more
- Available on the Pro subscription (add link to pricing page)

## Projects View

- Can now see all machines in a project in one place, and easily switch between them
- New look + feel, minimalist (talk about design updates for easier reading)

## Visibility & roles

- Privacy is important: machines contain business logic which you may not want the world to see
- Projects can be made unlisted (anyone with link can view) or private (only you/your team can view if it is your/your team's project)
- Roles can be assigned to team members: admin, editor, viewer (will copy-paste details from Kevin) 
- Available on the Pro subscription (add link to pricing page)

## More export options

- JSON (existing, not the most useful for real-world projects using XState - add link to XState)
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Coming soon:
  - Markdown
  - CodeSandbox
  - StackBlitz
  - SVG, PNG
  - And others: make your request at (canny link)

## Improved designs

- States have more space to more easily create new states
- Guarded transitions are now individual transitions connected with dotted line and starting with diamond
  - Should feel familiar to those who have worked with flowcharts
- Improved simulation mode designs
- Many other design improvements

## Tutorials

- New tutorials view - click question mark
- Get an overview of everything you can do in the editor
- Learn about the different parts of state machines/statecharts

## What's next

- Working on more collaborative features, especially commenting, GitHub integration
- Working towards XState parity: full support for all XState features
- Working on support for other kinds of directed graphs, such as those from other workflow engines, CI/CD pipelines, etc.
- Working on more export options: PNG/SVG, Markdown, embedded editor
- Working on static graph analysis to help you catch logic errors ahead of time, which is something that's very difficult to do with plain code (made easier with Stately)
- Examples, examples, examples (and new documentation)
