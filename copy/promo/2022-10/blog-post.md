# Introducing Stately Studio 1.0

Weâ€™re excited to announce the release of Stately Studio 1.0! ðŸš€ We strongly believe that app logic should be visually collaborative, and weâ€™ve been worked hard to make that a reality. Weâ€™ve been working on Stately Studio for over a year now, and weâ€™re thrilled to share it with you.

## Thank you for your support!

Earlier this year, we released the first beta of Stately Editor & Stately Registry (together called the Stately Studio). We also released Stately Viz, a visualizer for XState machines, and the XState VS Code extension. Since then, over 10,000 of you have tried our tools out, creating and sharing tens of thousands of machines (we don't know the exact number because machines built with the extension are always private!) 

Thank you for giving our tools a go and for all the valuable feedback you've given us; we've been blown away by the response. We're listening and continuing to improve the Stately Studio. As always, you can [create and upvote feature requests on our Canny roadmap](https://statelyai.canny.io).

## Teams

Collaborating on app logic is one of Statelyâ€™s key goals. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve introduced teams, where you can organize, privately share, and edit projects with your teammates. A project is a collection of related machines you can keep to yourself or share with your team. You can invite teammates to your team, and they can join your team by accepting the invitation.

The Teams feature is the first step to providing more powerful collaboration features. Weâ€™re working on GitHub integration with public and private repos, commenting, machine revisions with visual diffs, multiplayer mode for collaboratively editing machines in real time, and much more.

Teams (previously known as Systems) are available on [our new Pro subscription](https://stately.ai/pricing).

## Machine visibility and roles

Machines may contain business logic you donâ€™t want to share with the world; thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve introduced visibility and roles. You can set a machine to be private, public, or unlisted. Private machines are only visible to you and your teammates. Public machines are visible to everyone, and [discoverable through search](https://stately.ai/registry/discover). Unlisted machines are only visible to those with the link, as they donâ€™t appear in search results.

You can also set roles for teammates to restrict how they can edit projects and machines. You can set a teammate to be a viewer, editor, or admin. Viewers can view projects and machines, but canâ€™t edit them. Editors can edit projects and machines, but canâ€™t delete them. Admins can do everything, including assigning roles.

Private/unlisted machines and team roles are available on [our new Pro subscription.](https://stately.ai/pricing)

## Editor redesign

You might have noticed a refreshed redesign of the editor. The editor view is now more project-centric, allowing you to switch between machines with a single click. And weâ€™ve improved the layout of states to give you more space to create and rearrange states. 

Weâ€™ve also redesigned guarded transitions. They are now individual transitions connected with a dotted line and a diamond, which should feel natural to anyone that has worked with flowcharts. The separated transitions make it easier to read and arrange the conditions for each transition, allowing you to change the source and target states of individual transitions quickly.

Simulation mode has also been redesigned, making it easier to see active states and transitions. There are many more improvements to the editor, but weâ€™ll leave them to you to discover.

## More export options

You asked, and we listened (weâ€™re currently in the listening state). Weâ€™ve added more export options beyond JSON, including JavaScript and TypeScript. We have plans to add more export options in the future, including:

- Markdown
- CodeSandbox
- StackBlitz
- SVG, PNG, PDF

And others. [Request your favorite export options on our Canny roadmap](https://statelyai.canny.io).

## Whatâ€™s next?

We have so many things planned for the future:

- A Stately GitHub integration for public and private repos
- XState parity: supporting all of XStateâ€™s features in the Stately Studio (weâ€™re almost there!)
- More export options and an embeddable editor
- Support for other graph-based tools, CI/CD pipelines and other workflow engines/DSLs
- Static graph analysis to help you catch logic errors ahead of time, which is difficult to do with plain code
- Many more examples, tutorials, videos, and documentation

## Try out the Studio
