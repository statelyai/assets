[‚û°Ô∏è Get access today](https://stately.ai/studio)

[Stately](https://stately.ai) is the visual software platform for app logic and workflows, and [Stately Studio](https://stately.ai/studio) now enables you to collaborate on flows with your team with many new features:

ü§ù **Teams (pro)**: create teams, invite team members, assign roles (admin, editor, or viewer), and share projects with your team.

üì¶ **Projects**: formerly called ‚Äúsystems‚Äù, you can now see all project machines in a single editor view, making it easier to manage.

üî≠ **Access control (pro)**: set projects to public, unlisted (visible only by link), or private (visible only to you/your team).

‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Export options**: export to JSON, JavaScript, or TypeScript, preview the code, and use it directly in your apps with [XState](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate)

üë©‚Äçüè´ **Help view**: learn about the different parts of state machines & statecharts, as well as how to do things in the editor, in a new side view

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Priority support (pro)**: get dedicated help quickly as a pro subscriber
