The Stately Studio supports everything you need to build state machines and statecharts visually. We hope you find the following tutorials help you learn more about the statecharts concepts and using the Stately Studio. 

If you have further questions or want to discuss modeling with other statecharts fans, [join our Discord community](https://discord.gg/xstate) or [chat with us live in our next office hours](https://youtube.com/c/statelyai).
