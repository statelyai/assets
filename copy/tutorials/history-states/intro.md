## History states

A history state returns the parent state to its most recently active child state. The box with an H inside represents the history state.

The history state can be deep or shallow:

- A shallow history state remembers the immediate childâ€™s state.
- A deep history state remembers the deepest active state or states inside its child states.

[TODO: Why you might use a history state with example.]
