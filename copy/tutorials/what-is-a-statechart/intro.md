### What is a statechart?

Statecharts are fancy state machines used to model more complex logic.

Statecharts are a visual extension to state machines that use boxes and arrows, much like flowcharts and sequence diagrams. Statecharts add extra features not available in ordinary state machines, including hierarchy (parent states), concurrency (parallel states) and communication (actors).

When you make a state machine in Stately Studio, itâ€™s also a statechart!
