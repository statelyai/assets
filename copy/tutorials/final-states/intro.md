When a machine reaches the final state, it can no longer receive any events, and anything running inside it is canceled and cleaned up. The box with a surrounding border icon represents the final state.

A machine can have multiple final states or no final states.

In the video player below, *Stopped* is the final child state in the *Opened* state. When the video player is *Stopped*, the video player moves to its *Closed* state.
