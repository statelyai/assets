## Export as code

You can export your machine as JSON, JavaScript, and TypeScript code using the code panel in the right tool menu. You can also export as code from the **Export machine** dialog using the export icon button in the editorâ€™s top bar.

Exporting as code is useful if you want to use your machine with [XState](https://xstate.js.org) inside your codebase or if you want to duplicate your machine without using **Fork**.
