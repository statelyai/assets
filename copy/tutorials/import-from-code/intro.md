## Import from code

You can import an existing machine from code using the code panel in the right tool menu. You can also create a new machine inside a project by importing code from the **Machines** list in the left drawer.

Importing from code is helpful if you have already been using XState, or have created a machine using our older [Stately Viz](https://stately.ai/viz) but haven’t yet tried the Stately visual editor.
