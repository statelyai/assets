## Eventless transitions

**Eventless transitions** are transitions without events. These transitions are *always* taken after any transition in their state is enabled. No event is necessary to trigger the transition.

Eventless transitions are labeled “always” and often referred to as “always” transitions.

[TODO: Why you might use an eventless transition with example.]
